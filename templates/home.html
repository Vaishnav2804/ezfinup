                <h1 class="display-5 text-center">Overview</h1>
                <p align="justify">The stock market is a vast array of investors and traders who buy and sell
                    stock, pushing the price up or down. The prices of stocks are governed by the principles of demand
                    and supply, and the ultimate goal of buying shares is to make money by buying stocks in companies
                    whose perceived value (i.e., share price) is expected to rise. Stock markets are closely linked with
                    the world of economics â€”the rise and fall of share prices can be traced back to some Key Performance
                    Indicators (KPI's). The five most commonly used KPI's are the opening stock price (`Open'),
                    end-of-day price (`Close'), intraday low price (`Low'), intra-day peak price (`High'), and total
                    volume of stocks traded during the day (`Volume'). Economics and stock prices are mainly reliant
                    upon subjective perceptions about the stock market. It is near impossible to predict stock prices to
                    the T, owing to the volatility of factors that play a major role in the movement of prices. However,
                    it is possible to make an educated estimate of prices. Stock prices never vary in isolation: the
                    movement of one tends to have an avalanche effect on several other stocks as well. This aspect of
                    stock price movement can be used as an important tool to predict the prices of many stocks at once.
                    Due to the sheer volume of money involved and number of transactions that take place every minute,
                    there comes a trade-off between the accuracy and the volume of predictions made; as such, most stock
                    prediction systems are implemented in a distributed, parallelized fashion. These are some of the
                    considerations and challenges faced in stock market analysis.
                </p>

                <h1 class="display-5 text-center">objective</h1>
                <p align="justify">In the past decades, there is an increasing interest in predicting markets among
                    economists, policymakers, academics and market makers. The objective of the proposed work is to
                    study and improve the supervised learning algorithms to predict the stock price.
                </p>

                <h1 class="display-5 text-center">Problem Definition</h1>
                <p align="justify">Predicting stock market prices is a complex task that traditionally involves
                    extensive human-computer interaction. Due to the correlated nature of stock prices, conventional
                    batch processing methods cannot be utilized efficiently for stock market analysis. We propose an
                    online learning algorithm that utilizes a kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long Short
                    Term Memory (LSTM), where the weights are adjusted for individual data points using stochastic
                    gradient descent. This will provide more accurate results when compared to existing stock price
                    prediction algorithms. The network is trained and evaluated for accuracy with various sizes of data,
                    and the results are tabulated. A comparison with respect to accuracy is then performed against an
                    Artificial Neural Network.
